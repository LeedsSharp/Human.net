The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and the approximately 5 liters of blood that the blood vessels transport. 
Responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and cellular waste products throughout the body, the cardiovascular system is 
powered by the body’s hardest-working organ — the heart, which is only about the size of a closed fist. 

Even at rest, the average heart easily pumps over 5 liters of blood throughout the body every minute.

Blood consists of Plasma, RedBloodCells, WhiteBloodCells, Platelets
Blood removes metabolic waste
Heart has four chambers 
	upper left and right atria; and lower left and right ventricles

Blood flows one way through the Heart due to HeartValves
	HeartValves prevent backflow
